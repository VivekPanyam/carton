# Pack a PyTorch model

There are two different types of PyTorch models:

- [TorchScript models](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html)
- Other PyTorch models

See the sections below for more details.

## PyTorch

Because PyTorch models can contain arbitrary python code, they are packed the same as arbitrary python code.

Please see the [Python packing docs](/docs/packing/python).

## TorchScript

Carton can run TorchScript models without requiring Python at runtime. This allows you to run your model completely in native code.

Please see the [TorchScript packing docs](/docs/packing/torchscript).
