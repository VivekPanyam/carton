# Loading a model

Once you have a packed model, you can pass in a file path or URL to the model.

```python
# TODO: actually make this a runnable example with correct output
import asyncio
import cartonml as carton

async def main():
    model = await carton.load("https://carton.pub/google-research/bert-base-uncased")
    out = await model.infer("Today is a very good [MASK].")
    print(out)
    # day

asyncio.run(main())
```

Carton loads the model (caching it locally if necessary).

If you need a packed model, take a look at the [packing docs](/docs/packing) or explore the [community model registry](https://carton.pub).

## Load an unpacked model

Carton also supports loading an unpacked model via the `load_unpacked` method. This is conceptually the same as `pack` followed by `load`, but is implemented more efficiently internally. It supports all the options that `load` and `pack` support.

See the [quickstart guide](/quickstart) for an example.

# Options

There are a few options you can pass in when loading a model, but none of them are required.

### `visible_device`
<div className='text-slate-500'>Type: string</div>

The device that is visible to this model.

Allowed values:
 - `cpu`
 - A GPU index (e.g. `0`, `1`, etc.)
 - A GPU UUID (including the `GPU-` or `MIG-GPU-` prefix).<br/>See https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars for more details.

Note: a visible device does not necessarily mean that the model will use that device; it is up to the model to actually use it (e.g. by moving itself to GPU if it sees one available).

```python
await carton.load(
    # ...
    visible_deivce = "0",
)
```

### `override_runner_opts`
<div className='text-slate-500'>Type: (see below)</div>

Options to pass to the runner. These are runner-specific (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc).

Overrides are merged with the options set when packing the model.

These are sometimes used to configure thread-pool sizes, etc.

For allowed values, see the [packing docs](/docs/packing) for each framework.

```python
await carton.load(
    # ...
    override_runner_opts = {
        # For example, if we know this is a torchscript model and we want to set
        # threading configuration for running this model.
        # TODO: torchscript support isn't implemented yet
        "num_interop_threads": 4,
        "num_threads": 1,
    },
)
```

### `override_required_framework_version`
<div className='text-slate-500'>Type: string</div>

This is a semver version range that specifies the version of the framework that the model requires.

See https://docs.rs/semver/1.0.16/semver/enum.Op.html and https://docs.rs/semver/1.0.16/semver/struct.VersionReq.html for more details on version ranges.

This is useful if a model is limited to a specific framework version range and you want to override it.

Note: this is not guaranteed to work if the underlying model isn't compatible with the version range you specify.

```python
await carton.load(
    # ...

    # If we know this is a python model and we want to force it to
    # run with a `3.10.x` version of python.
    override_required_framework_version = "=3.10",
)
```
